# AGU WAY üó∫Ô∏è

This application is our term project for the COMP205 course. We developed it with my friend @kadirkilicoglu.

## About Application

This project is a navigation system designed to help students easily find classrooms. We utilized the Google Maps API for this project. During the development, we faced a significant challenge‚Äîindoor navigation. To address this issue, we came up with a clever solution. As people approach doors whose locations are stored in our code, we display the floor plans of the corresponding building. In this way, individuals can effortlessly locate classrooms. You can find screenshots of the application below.
